# Simple_Calculator- Calculator.py is the main file
The rest of the .py files are modules.

The calculator unfortunately does not take fraction values so try to convert your fractions into decimals
before using the calculator. (You could also convert the fractions to decimals through the simple calculator.)

The calculator takes two numbers, with an operator as well. (+, -, *, /, or ^)

This calculator can also process negative numbers.

I got the idea from this website.
I actually barely looked at the tutorial and just got the idea of the simple calculator off it.

Changes made:

1. Used an if/else function instead
2. Originally I coded it in Java, converted it to Python by learning if/else 
3. Learnt functions and exceptions so I modded my old calculator to use those
4. Another if else operator added
5. Added parameters in my function
6. Added modules
7. Added class
8. Added while loops, user can restart
9. Added try except but implementing while loops
10. Added more functions
